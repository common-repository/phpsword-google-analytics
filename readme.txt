The PHP codes of this plugin save the Google tracking codes in the website database. Once the pages of your website are accessed by the users, WordPress loads an action hook named `wp_footer` on every page request. On every `wp_footer` action hook, the plugin appends the analytics code to the pages. The procedure is the same for all post types such as the home page, category page, post pages or custom pages. This enables Google to access and track all the pages of your website properly.
